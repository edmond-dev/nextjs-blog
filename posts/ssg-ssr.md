I have been building on my technical skills through personal projects by developing APIs. The first project was a sample ecommerce platform which was done in a monolithic type of architecture (github.com/edmond-dev/server-bof). This was more learning than developing an actual site. Currently, I am engaged in a bigger personal project in which am using gRPC to develop the project in a microservice architecture which offers more flexibility as I advance with the project and this engagement also keeps me in touch with new tech while exploring more technologies.

 My area of interest is mostly working on the backend. Am also leveraging my backend skills and knowledge to stack up on skills in:

 - os & kernels
 - networks
 - distributed systems and parallel computing
 - mobile systems
 - compilers and language tools
 - For client in web programming, I only utilize http and go html packages.

 My goal is *I just develop and build softwares and systems for all*
