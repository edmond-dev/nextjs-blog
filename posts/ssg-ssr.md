I have been building on my technical skills through class projects and personal projects. My classes have been so significant in sharpening my skills. For instance, during my winter class, I took a bash scripting class in which I worked on several scripts that, for example read urls from a file, the script also checked the responsiveness of the urls through parsing an http code from the returned curl results of the url.  As an assignment, I also coded a script that was used to create users in linux and managing users permissions. We also worked on git, which helped me form a solid foundation in version control in software deveopment and management.
Outside of class, I used some the skills gained from my classes to real world application. The first project was a sample ecommerce platform which was done in a monolithic type of architecture. In a monolithic architechure, version control and database management is less complex compared to microservices. I explored both known architechures as way to experiment with software development process in different scenarios and also as a way to see the practical use of tech tools that I have learned from class. Through involvement in class projects and experimental personal projects, I have become more confident and have gained knowledge and some experience in software development.

My current skills and technologies mastered are:

 Programming languages:
 - C++
 - gRPC
 - Golang
 - javascript

 Misc.
 - Linux Ubuntu -Bash scripting

 Databases:
 - Mysql
 - MongoDB 

 Cloud:
  - Cloud platforms and models

 Containers:
 - Docker
 - Kubernetes

 Certifications:
 - Cloud core - IBM cloud
   Familiar with essentials of cloud application and terms:
   - Public, private and hybrid multi clouds.
   - Devops, microservices, serverless, Cloud native, virtualization, VMs, Object Storage.

 Containers & kubernetes:
   - YAML deployment file, exposing deployment as a service
   - Manage applications with kubernetes, use ReplicaSets, auto scaling.
   - Benefits of Openshift and Istio

 MongoDB Data modelling and Aggregation Framework

 My area of interest is mostly working on the backend. Am also leveraging my backend skills and knowledge to stack up on skills in:

 - os & kernels
 - networks
 - distributed systems and parallel computing
 - mobile systems
 - compilers and language tools
 - For client in web programming, I only utilize http and go html packages.

 My goal is *I just want to develop and build softwares and systems for all*
